# Intrduction

Phylogenetic eigenvector maps (PEM) are descriptors and, as such, it is
straightforward to use them in any sort of models involving descriptors. For
predicting qualitative traits, one can use PEM within logistic regression (for
binary traits), multinomial regression or linear discriminant analysis (for
multiclass qualitative traits), machine learning methods such as regression
trees, random forest, artificial neural network, and so on. However, the method
described by Guénard et al. 2016 to estimate the parameters of the trait
evolution model does not lend itself to qualitative traits (binary or
multiclass) and other non-normally distributed traits.

In this research document, we will outline the particular challenges associated
with estimating qualitative traits and propose avenues of research oriented
toward estimating the probabilities for species for bearing particular
qualitative trait values. Although it is possible to propose modifications of
the original PEM calculation method adapted to use qualitative response
variables directly, we will hereby focus our efforts at specifying
transformations to obtain surrogate variables directly suitable to the actual
evolution model estimation maximum linklihood estimator (MLE). A secondary goal
of this enquiry is thus to explore the potentiel benefits (in terms of adequacy,
flexibility, ease of application, and so on) of qualitative traits
transformation methods. We expect that this investigation will help us identify
potential methodological gaps that could motivate the adaptation of PEM to the
estimation of qualitative trait evolution beyond trait transformation.

## Neutral and selective evolution in categorical traits

Traits, be they qualitative or quantitative, are seldom the feat of single genes
operating in isolation, but come from complex webs of interacting genes. Once a
particular mutation occurs in a population, it is unlikely to make a new
qualitative trait manifest itself in a given individual, but will instead make a
trait showing up with some frequency in the population. Whereas a trait that is
beneficial to the organisms (on average) will likely increase in frequency on
the long run, through selective processes, its frequency will eventually
fluctuate (alongside other modalities of the trait) with the changing
environment. Also, selection gradient for a given qualitative trait modality may
also depend on the frequency of other modalities and their interaction with the
environment (frequency-dependent selection). On the other hand, random mortality
and reproductive success.




For these reasons, qualitative trait values 


The statement that a categorical trait may evolve neutrally may appears as a
contraduction. Since a given modality of a qualitative trait is either present
or not in a species, it is tempting to conclude that qualitative trait evolution
is inherently non-neutral. As a textbook example, a given individual acquire a
fateful mutation underlying the sudden apparition of a whole new trait (or a
whole new modality of an esisting trait), enabling it and its descendants to
thrive and eventually form a new species (or subspecies, ecotype, and so on).
However, as with most (if not all) textbook cases, this depiction is, perhaps,
somewhat oversimplistic. For instance, 

Therefore, whereas 






# Method

The following packages and `R` language code will be needed throughout the
present research document:

```{r}
library(adespatial)
library(magrittr)
##
pcoa <- function(x, method, tol=sqrt(.Machine$double.eps)) {
  Q <- function(x) {diag(x) - matrix(1/x,x,x)}
  x %>%
  dist.ldc(Y, method=method) %>%
  as.matrix %>%
  {Q(nrow(.)) %*% (-0.5*.^2) %*% Q(ncol(.))} %>%
  eigen -> out
  out %<>%
    {.$vector[,.$values>=tol] %*%
        diag(sqrt(.$values[.$values>=tol]))}
  out %>%
    {list(
      rownames(x),
      sprintf("PCoord %d",1:ncol(.))
    )} -> dimnames(out)
  out
}

```

## Data transformation

Qualitative variables are categorical (in the mathematical sense of "involving,
according with, or considered with respect to specific categories", [see](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/categorical). In the simplest
case, a binary trait has two states (eg., the presence of abence of a given
structure) and can be represented as a single variables taking either the value
$0$ (eg., when the structure is absent) or $1$ (eg., then the structure is
present). In the case of a trait involving multiple ($m$) categories, a set of
$m-1$ such binary (or dummy) variables needs to be involved in order to
represent all the possibilities (since one modality in the trait can be deducted
from the absence of all others).

In this research document, we will explore transformations of the 




## Binary traits

In this section, we will explore the simplest case of qualitative traits: binary
traits. A binary trait is a trait that a species either has or does not have.
Binary traits can be represented by logistic regression (or other suitable
methods) using the PEM and, posssibly, other anxiliary traits. 








### Generation of a set of binary traits

```{r}
runif(1000,0,1) %>%
  {ifelse(.>0.5,0,1)} %>%
  matrix(ncol=100) -> traits
traits %>%
  {list(
    sprintf("Species %d",1:nrow(.)),
    sprintf("Trait %d",1:ncol(.))
  )} -> dimnames(traits)
traits[,1:9]
```

## Calculation of the principal components

```{r}
traits %>%
  pcoa("jaccard") -> cmp
cmp
```



```{r}
cmp %>% shapiro.test
## cmp %>% length %>% rnorm(0,1) %>% shapiro.test
```

```{r}
traits %>% {sqrt(./rowSums(.))} -> hel
## hel[,1:5]
hel %>% shapiro.test
hel %>%
  scale(center=TRUE, scale=FALSE) %>%
  svd %>%
  {.$u[,.$d>.Machine$double.eps^0.5]*.$d[.$d>.Machine$double.eps^0.5]} -> pc
pc[,1:5]
pc %>%
  shapiro.test
pc %>% cor %>% det
```
